      "Though the homeopathic medicine practitioners state that kali phos is safe for all age groups, it is recommended that conventional medications or interventions should not be replaced with homeopathy. Do not postpone seeing a healthcare provider about a serious medical problem. If there are constant issues with memory, severe fatigue that does not go away, constant headaches, insomnia, and gastric upset, it is better to visit a practitioner of modern medicine and get the required tests done to rule out causes other than stress.\n",

      "The possibility of bacterial growth in the preparations\n",
      "The liquid preparations offered to kids may contain alcohol as a solvent\n",
      "Therefore, people must avoid taking kali phos (or any other homeopathic medication) if they are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have immunodeficiencies. Children and adolescents younger than 18 years old must be given such medication only after discussing it with a healthcare provider.\n",
      "\n",
